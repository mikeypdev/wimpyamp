The characters in text.bmp are in four sections, with three lines in each
section.

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"@  
0123456789….:()-'!_+\/[]^&%,=$
ÅÖÄ?* 

NOTE: The rightmost part of A is used as a padding character, x=4 y=0 w=1
h=6 
The 'A' character is 5x6 as all other characters but don't use the
rightmost column, because is used as a black padding character to the right of
the song title, when it is shorter than the display.

NOTE: The default skin has a '@' character that is 6x6 but only 5x6 is
actually drawn.

NOTE: after the @ character in line 1, there should be two more characters, one is the "time display symbol" and the other is "title display space"

NOTE: there is one character after the * (asterisk), which is the "kbps display space"

NOTE: in the default skin, the 3-line pattern of characters is repeated four
times, for a total of 12 lines. The 1st section is used by default, with the
other used in different text situations (TBD).

NOTE: Some skins might omit the repeating character patterns and only include the
1st section of 3 lines. The app MUST account for these skin varients of text.bmp.
